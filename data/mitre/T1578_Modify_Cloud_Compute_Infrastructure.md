# T1578 - Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure

**Tactic:** Defense Evasion
**Platforms:** IaaS
**Reference:** https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578

## Description

An adversary may attempt to modify a cloud account's compute service infrastructure to evade defenses. A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.

Permissions gained from the modification of infrastructure components may bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing infrastructure. Modifying infrastructure components may also allow an adversary to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.

## Detection

### Detection Analytics

**Analytic 0861**

Detection focuses on identifying unauthorized or anomalous changes to compute infrastructure components. Defender perspective: monitor for creation, deletion, or modification of instances, volumes, and snapshots outside of approved change management windows; correlate abnormal activity such as rapid snapshot creation followed by new instance mounts, or repeated infrastructure changes by rarely used accounts. Flagging activity linked to unusual geolocation, API client, or automation script is suspicious.


## Mitigations

### M1047 - Audit

Routinely monitor user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to modify cloud compute infrastructure components.

### M1018 - User Account Management

Limit permissions for creating, deleting, and otherwise altering compute components in accordance with least privilege. Organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.
